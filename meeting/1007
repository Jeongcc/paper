[Experiment Result]

10GB -> 100GB (10GB is too small to show difference between priority)
change in key size (16 -> 32 but return 16 again in next experiment)

1) fillrandom, compaction priority 1, write only
2) fillrandom, compaction priority 2, write only
3) mixgraph, compaction priority 1, write intensive
4) mixgraph, compaction priority 2, write intensive

1)2) result shows as expected. But from result of 3)4), figured out QPS's effect to throughput 
so decided to run next experiment with QPS default or MAX or without throuput
