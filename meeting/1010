[Experiment]
''compaction priority 1''
1-fillrandom
2-readrandom, use existing db
3-mixgraph, read intensive, use existing db
4-mixgraph, write intensive, use existing db

''compaction priority 2''
1-fillrandom
2-readrandom, use existing db
3-mixgraph, read intensive, use existing db
4-mixgraph, write intensive, use existing db


[Experimental Result]
result between 1-1, 1-2 is opposite, need reexperiment
I suspect that ssd format issue, key size issue, or unknown dbbench process issue would be cause
So, ssd status check under each experiment and process check is needed
